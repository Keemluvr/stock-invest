- [x] Current price compared to other stocks;
- [x] Projection of earnings with purchase on a specific date.

# How to run the application locally

1. Install packages `npm install`
2. Start development server `npm run start`

# How to run tests

1. Install packages `npm install`
2. Start development server `npm run cypress`

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run prepare`

Command needed to configure [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/), it runs automatically after installing all dependencies

**Note: Yarn 2+ doesn't support prepare lifecycle script, so husky needs to be installed differently (this doesn't apply to Yarn 1 though). See [Yarn 2+ install](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=yarn-2).**

### `npm run lint`

This command will use a tool called ESLint, where it will identify and report patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, in order to make the code more consistent and avoid bugs.

ESLint settings file is found in the root of the webapp with the name **.eslintrc**

### `npm run format`

Use a tool called Prettier that will format the code, thus ensuring a consistent style in the code.

Prettier settings file is found in the root of the webapp with the name **.prettierrc**
